# Postering

All the buildings stand next to each other. Together
form a long wall of buildings of varying heights, stretching from the east to
west. The mayor decided that the wall of buildings belongs to the north
cover the pages with posters. He wonders what minimum number of posters you can
cover the entire northern wall of the buildings. Posters should be in the shape of rectangles with sides
vertical and horizontal. Posters must not overlap, but they may touch each other
to the shores. Each poster must be entirely adjacent to the walls of certain buildings and the whole
the area of the northern walls of buildings must be covered with posters.
